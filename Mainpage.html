		<h3>What Is CoVID-19?</h3>
		<p class="p1"> CoVID-19, or Coronavirus disease 2019, is a viral disease
			caused by a strand of the coronavirus. The coronavirus can lead
			to respiratory disease as mild as the common cold, or severe as
			MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS (Severe Acute 
			Respiratory Syndrome).</p>
		<p class="p1"> The first case of CoVID-19 was detected on December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
			There are currently over 150 000 cases worldwide. </p>
		<h3>How It Spreads</h3>
			<p class="p1"> CoVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets
			from an infected person. These respiratory droplets are released
			once an infected person coughs or sneezes and then travel by air.
			Droplets infect others once inhaled, or land on surfaces and infect
			individuals after they touch a contaminated surface and
			then touch their face.

		<h3>Myths</h3>
		<p class="p1"> There are a couple myths surrounding CoVID-19. Some include
		<ol class="p1" style="padding-left: 120px; text-align:justify">
			<li><strong>Africans are less susceptible to CoVID-19 and may even be immune.</strong> This
				is not true at all. Africans are just as likely of being infected with CoVID-19 as 
				other places.</li>
			<li><strong>I am unlikely to be infected with CoVID-19.</strong> As more and more cases are 
				confirmed in your area, the chances of being infected increase. To ensure safety please
				take <a href="precaution.html">precaution</a> and follow the advice of WHO and your health care advisors </li>
			<li><strong>I can take medicine to stay safe from CoVID-19.</strong> There is currently no
				medicine to treat or prevent CoVID-19. Please take <a href="precaution.html">precaution</a> to protect yourself and
				your community</li>
			<li><strong>I should wear a mask to protect myself.</strong> Only wear a mask if you are showing symptoms 
				of CoVID-19, such as coughing and sneezing. If you do not have symptoms do not wear a mask</li>
			<li><strong>It does not matter if I do not self isolate even though I might be infected with CoVID-19.</strong>THIS IS
				NOT TRUE! CoVID-19 is easily spread throughout a community. Somalia currently does not have enough resources
				to handle CoVID-19 as efficiently as other countries do. We are trying our best, however, to lower the risk of 
				millions dying, please self isolate for a period of 14 days. Doing so will only protect yourself and your community</li>
			<li><strong>There is no point in contacting emergency services or health care providers. They can do nothing.</strong> This is
				not true. We are currently working with organizations around the world to handle CoVID-19 as best as we can. However, we can only
				do our best if every community memember cooporates with our efforts. Please contact us if you, or anyone you know may have CoVID-19</li>
			<li><strong>I can protect myself from CoVID-19 by smoking, wearing multiple face masks, or taking antibiotics.</strong> This is not true, and
				may even be harmful. To protect yourself please take <a href="precaution.html">precaution</a> outlined here.</p>
